When I was eight, I wanted to make video games. My dad had worked in the games industry, though he left it before I was old enough to use that for playground cred and he hadn't made any games my peers had heard of.

When I was twelve, my dad's stories of the atrocious hours and industry practice, combined with the demonic attitude of my best friend's mother, which I blamed on her employment at Electronic Arts, convinced me that making games for a living wasn't a path to enjoying life, so I started thinking about other things you could do with programming. It turns out I quite enjoyed programming as an intellectual pursuit separate from video games and thought maybe I could just avoid the games industry.

In high school I learned that whenever I get paid to do something, it saps my enjoyment from it and true enough, every great job I've ever had turned out to be a time bomb.
Because I was aware of this early, I tried to protect the things I most loved doing by not pursuing them as careers. I stopped trying to program for a living, stopped trying to take photographs. But eventually, I lost the only job I thought I could do forever and the only way to get another one by the time the tuition bill was due was to take up a tech job.

At first it was okay, but soon the money was making the work seem meaningless... and at the time the work was meaningless. So I moved on and after while came to some conclusions.

- Part time programming isn't a possibility for me since I like throwning myself completely at what I'm doing
- Not working while I finish school isn't something I could afford

I was fortunate enough to find a position in the tech industry that didn't require programming but did involve problem solving and human interaction: user support.

Support has been a wonderful thing for me. I've gotten so much better at writing clearly, at understanding the difference between how I perceive the tools I write and how my intended audience will, at applying empathy rather than just having it. But when I started, the best part about this job was that I couldn't do it for very long hours. I could about get in a full day's work and then I couldn't handle any more. For the first time since joining the tech industry I had recreational computer time again. For a while this was fantastic then a few things happened: I got good enough at what I was doing that I could work longer hours. I got salaried, so was no longer required to keep track of how much work I was doing. And I exhausted the secret skill tree of "career progression" available to me where I work. Doing the same thing for two years is enough to burn anyone out, but doing the same thing for two years and not having anything else you can work toward is killer.

The world in my mind is hyper contradictory. The best short version I can say is that I'm a hyper-focused single task individual, but I don't get to pick what I am focused on.

This leads to a lot of long focused hours and sleepless nights. But it also means writing off entire days to fixation on the "wrong" thing.
