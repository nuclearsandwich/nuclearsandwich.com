This web page is primarily my own creation. However, I stand on the shoulders of
giants and would give credit to a few of them.

- The fonts used on this site are Fauna One by Eduardo Tunni, Quicksand by Andrew Paglinawan, and Anonymous Pro by Mark Simonson

- [Pygments][] (via [pygments.rb][]) is used for code highlighting along with
the Monokai color scheme realized in CSS by Pygments.

- The [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) is the language which stitches up my
haphazard writings into a coherent whole. Thanks to the Ruby core team!

- Part of the impetus for writing my own static site generator was my preference
for [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) over the liquid template language
used by Jekyll and Octopress. Many thanks to [Chris Wanstrath][defunkt] for it!

- I use [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) to start from
a single base point with the styles on this site. Thanks Nicolas Gallagher and
Jonathan Neal.

- There's a lovely little gem called [rerun][] by [Alex Chaffee][alexch] that I
use to watch and rebuild the site in development. It's awesome.
