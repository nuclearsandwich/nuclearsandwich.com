I'm a human software engineer who delights in building tools, utilties, and applications that make productivity fun and exciting.
Currently I spend most of my time in Raleigh, NC but the long term goal is to return to the Bay Area in California.
I am enamored of the absense of weather.

In the past I've been involved in the San Francisco and South Bay Area RailsBridge organizations and have been a coach for Rails Girls events in San Francisco and Raleigh.
I was an early mentor and curriculum author for Silicon Valley Coder Dojo and hope to resume teaching and growing that organization when I return to the area.

I had the privilege and pleasure of speaking at the 2012 Golden Gate Ruby Conference about peeling back the syntactic sugar of Ruby to expose newcomers to the language's internals.
If you're interested you can check out that talk: [Sugar-Free Ruby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNbBC2pSiVw) on YouTube.

If you're looking for a dedicated and empathy-driven software engineer or consulting from a Git and GitHub specialist I am currently available for hire.
