# Hi and stuff

I read books, study math and computer science, play games, and write software.

If you don't know who I am, [look at this](/about.html).

Most of my writing of late has been private but look for new stuff soon.

If you're interested, I keep most of my projects [on GitHub](https://github.com/nuclearsandwich).
